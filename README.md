# Anime-Face-Generation-using-DCGAN
This project uses DCGAN with TensorFlow and Keras to generate realistic anime faces. A Generator creates images, while a Discriminator distinguishes real from fake ones. Trained on Kaggle, the model improves over time, producing high-quality anime-style faces. Features include data preprocessing, training visualization, and model saving. ðŸš€
